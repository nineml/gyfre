<p>Pragmas are a syntactic device to allow grammar writers to
communicate with processors in non-standard ways without interfering
with the operation of other processors. To avoid interference with
other processors, two requirements arise:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pragmas must be syntactically identifiable as such.</li>
<li>Also, it must be possible for processors to distinguish pragmas
directed at them from other pragmas.  This proposal uses namespaces,
QNames, and URI-qualified names to allow grammar writers and
implementations to avoid collisions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pragmas may affect the behavior of a processor in any way, either in
ways that leave the meaning of a grammar unchanged or in ways that
change the meaning of the grammar in which the pragmas appear.</p>

<p>Since specific pragmas will be understood by some processors and not
others, it is necessary in this proposal to discuss both how an
example might be processed by a processor which understands and
implements the pragma and how it will be processed by a processor
oblivious to it.  (See below for the terms <em>understand</em> and
<em>oblivious</em>.)</p>

<div id="ixml-syntax">

<h2>Syntax in iXML</h2>
</header>

<p>In ixml, pragmas are enclosed in square brackets, which contain an
optional mark, a qualified name in some form, and optionally
additional data, which takes the form of a sequence of
square-bracket-balanced characters. The relevant part of the ixml
grammar is:</p>

<pre class="ixml"><code>pragma: -"[", @pmark?, @pname, (whitespace, pragma-data)?, -"]".
@pname: -QName; -UQName.
@pmark: ["@^?"].
pragma-data: (-pragma-chars; -bracket-pair)*.
-pragma-chars: ~["[]"]+.
-bracket-pair: '[', -pragma-data, ']'.

-QName: -name, ':', -name.
-UQName: 'Q{', -ns-name, '}', -name.
-ns-name: ~["{}"; '"'; "'"]*
</code></pre>

<p>For example, the following are all syntactically well formed pragmas:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>[?my:blue]</code></li>
<li><code>[?Q{http://example.org/NS/mine}blue]</code></li>
<li><code>[@my:color blue]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>It is a consequence of the syntax that pragmas can contain nested
pairs of square brackets.</p>

<pre class="ixml"><code>[ls:rewrite
              comment: -"{", (cchars; comment)*, -"}".
              [ls:token] -cchars:  cchar+.
]
</code></pre>

<p>Here, in fact, the pragma contains a nested pragma, though the nesting
is only apparent to a processor which understands the <em>ls:rewrite</em>
pragma and knows to parse its pragma data as a sequence of rules in
ixml notation.  A processor which does <em>not</em> understand the
<em>ls:rewrite</em> pragma will merely know that the pragma data here
contains 100 characters, which happen to include one nested pair of
brackets.  That suffices.</p>

<p>Pragmas may appear:</p>

<ul>
<li>immediately before a terminal or nonterminal symbol in the
right-hand side of a rule, before or after its mark if any, or</li>
<li>immediately before the nonterminal symbol on the left-hand side of a
rule, before or after its mark if any, or</li>
<li>after the final alternative of a rule, before the full stop ending
the rule, or</li>
<li>before the first rule of the grammar.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the final case, each pragma must be followed by a full stop.</p>

<p>Each of these requires some changes to the grammar of ixml. To allow
pragmas immediately before symbols, we change the grammatical
definitions of symbols, both nonterminals:</p>

<pre class="ixml"><code>nonterminal: annotation, name, s.
-annotation:   (pragma, sp)?, (mark, sp)?.
-sp:  (s; pragma)*.
</code></pre>

<p>and terminals:</p>

<pre class="ixml"><code>-quoted: tannotation, -string.
-encoded: tannotation, -"#", @hex, s.
inclusion: tannotation,          set.
exclusion: tannotation, -"~", s, set.
-tannotation:  (pragma, sp)?, (tmark, sp)?.
</code></pre>

<p>To allow pragmas on the left-hand side of a rule and before its
closing full stop, we modify the definition of <code>rule</code>:</p>

<pre class="ixml"><code>rule: annotation, name, s, -["=:"], s, -alts, (pragma, sp)?, -".".
</code></pre>

<p>To allow pragmas before the first rule and to distinguish them from
pragmas occurring on the left-hand side of the first rule, we modify
the definition of <code>ixml</code> to introduce a <code>prolog</code>.</p>

<pre class="ixml"><code>ixml: prolog, rule+s, s.
prolog:  s, ppragma+s, s.
-ppragma:  pragma, s, -'.'.
</code></pre>
</div>

<div id="xml-syntax">
<header>
<h2>Syntax in XML</h2>
</header>

<p>Following the normal rules of ixml, pragmas are serialized as elements
named <code>pragma</code>, with attributes named <code>pmark</code> and
<code>pname</code> and an
optional child element named <code>pragma-data</code>. In addition, in XML
grammars <code>pragma</code> elements may contain any number of XML elements
following the <code>pragma-data</code> element.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="xml"><code>&lt;pragma pname="my:blue" pmark="?"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre class="xml"><code>&lt;pragma pname="Q{http://example.org/NS/mine}:blue" pmark="?"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre class="xml"><code>&lt;pragma pname="my:color" pmark="@"&gt;
    &lt;pragma-data&gt;blue&lt;/pragma-data&gt;
&lt;/pragma&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre class="xml"><code>&lt;pragma pname="ls:rewrite"&gt;
    &lt;pragma-data&gt;comment: -"{", (cchars; comment)*, -"}".
              [ls:token] -cchars:  cchar+.
&lt;/pragma-data&gt;
&lt;/pragma&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Pragma-oblivious processors and processors which do not implement the
pragma in question will as a matter of course produce <code>pragma</code>
elements with just the one child element (or none). But processors
which implement a given pragma are free to inject additional XML
elements into the XML form of the pragma. It is to be assumed that the
XML elements contain no additional information, only a mechanically
derived XML form which makes the information in the pragma easier to
process. It is to be expected that any software to serialize XML
grammars in ixml form will discard the additional XML elements.</p>

<p>For example, note that a processor which understands the <em>ls:rewrite</em>
pragma might prefer to produce a different XML representation for it,
e.g. one in which the embedded grammar rules have their normal XML
representation.  As noted above: pragmas may affect the behavior of a
processor in any way.  For such a processor, the XML representation
might be:</p>

<pre class="xml"><code>&lt;pragma pname="ls:rewrite"&gt;
    &lt;pragma-data&gt;comment: -"{", (cchars; comment)*, -"}".
              [ls:token] -cchars:  cchar+.
&lt;/pragma-data&gt;
    &lt;rule name="comment"&gt;
        &lt;alt&gt;
            &lt;literal dstring="{" tmark="-"/&gt;
            &lt;repeat0&gt;&lt;alts&gt;
                &lt;alt&gt;&lt;nonterminal name="cchars"/&gt;&lt;/alt&gt;
                &lt;alt&gt;&lt;nonterminal name="comment"/&gt;&lt;/alt&gt;
            &lt;/alts&gt;&lt;/repeat0&gt;
            &lt;literal dstring="}" tmark="-"/&gt;
        &lt;/alt&gt;
    &lt;/rule&gt;
    &lt;rule name="cchars" mark="-"&gt;
        &lt;pragma pname="ls:token"/&gt;
        &lt;alt&gt;
            &lt;repeat1&gt;&lt;alts&gt;
                &lt;alt&gt;&lt;nonterminal name="cchar"/&gt;&lt;/alt&gt;
            &lt;/alts&gt;&lt;/repeat0&gt;
        &lt;/alt&gt;
    &lt;/rule&gt;
&lt;/pragma&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Note that because the additional XML elements within the pragma are
just redundant XML representations of the pragma data, a
pragma-oblivious application to rewrite XML grammars in ixml form will
lose no information when transcribing this XML pragma as</p>

<pre class="ixml"><code>[ls:rewrite
              comment: -"{", (cchars; comment)*, -"}".
              [ls:token] -cchars:  cchar+.
]
</code></pre>

<p>It should be noted that the <em>pmark</em> allowed by the syntax has no
effect on the XML representation produced by the core rules of ixml.
Pragma-oblivious processors will always produce XML representation of
pragmas of the form described here. Pragma-aware processors may
implement pragmas which modify the standard XML representation
('pragmas for pragmas'). See [pragmas.md](pragmas.md) for an
example.</p>
</div>

<div id="scope">
<header>
<h2>Pragma scope</h2>
</header>

<p>In this proposal, pragmas always apply explicitly to some part of a
grammar:</p>

<ul>
<li>to a symbol occurrence in the right-hand side of a rule, or</li>
<li>to a rule</li>
<li>to the grammar as a whole</li>
</ul>

<p>The relation between a pragma and the part of the grammar to which
it applies is reflected in the XML form of a grammar: pragmas appear
as child elements of the part of the grammar they apply to (an element
named <code>ixml</code>, <code>rule</code>, <code>nonterminal</code>,
<code>literal</code>, <code>inclusion</code>, or
<code>exclusion</code>).</p>

<p>These associations between pragmas and parts of grammars are specified
here for clarity and to enable clearer discussion of pragmas, but they
have no effect on the operational semantics of ixml processors.  A
pragma-oblivious processor will not be affected by the pragmas,
regardless of what they apply to, and a processor that understands a
given pragma will know from its definition what changes in behavior it
requests.  The associations given above are thus of most direct use to
those specifying the meaning of specific pragmas.</p>
</div>

<div id="opsemantics">
<header>
<h2>Operational semantics</h2>
</header>

<p>In describing the operational semantics of pragmas, we distinguish
different classes of ixml processor:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>pragma-oblivious</em> processors recognize pragmas syntactically but
otherwise ignore them all, except for namespace
declarations. Informally, they do not 'understand' any pragmas, and
their only obligation is not to trip over pragmas when they encounter
them.</li>
<li><em>pragma-aware</em> processors recognize pragmas syntactically and modify
their behavior in accordance with some pragmas. Informally, they
'understand' some pragmas but not all. For each pragma they recognize,
they must determine whether it is one they 'understand' and implement,
or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>With regard to a given pragma, processors either <em>implement</em> that
pragma or they do not. A processor <em>implements</em> a pragma if and only if it
adjusts its behavior as specified by that pragma. In the ideal case
there will be some written specification of the pragma which describes
the operational effect of the pragma clearly. This proposal assumes
that a processor can use the qualified name of a pragma to determine
whether the processor implements the pragma or not and thus decide
whether to modify its normal operation or not.</p>

<p>The obligation of pragma-oblivious processors is to accept pragmas
when they occur in the ixml form of a grammar, and (if they are
producing an XML form of the grammar) to produce the correct XML form of
each pragma, just as they produce the corresponding XML form for any
construct in the grammar.</p>

<p>Pragma-aware processors <em class="rfc2119">must</em> similarly accept pragmas when they
occur in the ixml form of a grammar, and (if they are producing an XML
form of the grammar) produce the correct XML form of each pragma, just
as they produce the corresponding XML form for any construct in the
grammar. As already noted, however, pragmas may modify this behavior
like any other.</p>
</div>

<div id="conformance">
<header>
<h2>Conformance requirements for pragmas</h2>
</header>

<p>Processors <em class="rfc2119">must</em> be capable, at user option, of ignoring all pragmas
other than namespace declarations and processing a grammar using the
standard rules of ixml.</p>

<p>Processors which accept ixml grammars <em class="rfc2119">must</em>
accept pragmas in the ixml form of a grammar, whether they understand
or implement the specific pragmas or not.</p>

<p>Processors which accept XML grammars <em class="rfc2119">must</em>
accept pragmas in the XML form of a grammar, whether they understand
or implement the specific pragmas or not.</p>

<p>If a pragma which the processor does not understand or implement is
present in a grammar used to parse input, the processor <em class="rfc2119">must</em> process the grammar in the same way as if
the pragma were not present.</p>

<p>When ixml grammars are processed as input using the grammar for
ixml, processors <em class="rfc2119">must</em> produce the correct XML
form of each pragma, just as they produce the corresponding XML form
for any construct in the grammar, <em>except</em> as the processor's
behavior is affected by the presence of pragmas in the grammar for
ixml used to parse the input.</p>
</div>

<div id="xmlns">
<header>
<h2>Namespace declarations</h2>
</header>

<p>Namespace declarations take the form of a pragma appearing in the
prolog of a grammar and using the reserved prefix <em>ixmlns</em> in their
QName.  Their pragma data is interpreted an an IRI.</p>

<p>For example the following namespace declarations bind the prefix
“<code>xsd</code>” to the namespace for the XSD schema definition language, and
“<code>rng</code>” to that for Relax NG:</p>

<pre class="ixml"><code>[ixmlns:xsd http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema]
[ixmlns:rng http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0]
</code></pre>

<p>As is the case for XML namespaces generally, the pragma data <em class="rfc2119">should</em> be a legal URI, but ixml processors are
not obligated to check the URI for syntactic correctness (although
they are may do so), and normally <em class="rfc2119">should not</em>
attempt to dereference it.</p>

<p>The effect of a namespace declaration is to bind the local part of the
QName to the given namespace and allow it to be used as a prefix in
QNames to denote qualified names in the given namespace.</p>

<p>The following rules apply:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The prefix <em>ixmlns</em> is understood by all conforming ixml software as
  bound to the namespace-binding namespace
  “<code>http://example.com/ixml-namespaces</code>”.</p></li>
<li><p>A pragma with the unprefixed <em>ixmlns</em> is interpreted as defining a
  default namespace.</p></li>
<li><p>All namespace declarations pertain to the grammar as a whole and
  <em class="rfc2119">must</em> be given before the first rule of the grammar.</p></li>
<li><p>No two namespace declarations may bind the same prefix.</p></li>
<li><p>A nonterminal taking the lexical form of a QName <em class="rfc2119">must</em> if
serialized be serialized as an XML element name with the same local
name and with a prefix bound to the same namespace. Normally the
prefix <em class="rfc2119">should</em> be as given in the grammar. <em>(If all namespaces are
declared before the first rule, there should be no reason it should be
impossible to use the same prefix. Perhaps we can make this a
'<em class="rfc2119">must</em>'.)</em></p>
<p>The ixml processor is responsible for including appropriate
namespace declarations in the XML output.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the XML form of an ixml grammar, all namespaces bound in the
  ixml grammar <em class="rfc2119">should</em> be bound in the XML form of the grammar.</p>
<p>This should normally take the form of namespace declarations on the
<code>ixml</code> element.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="variations" class="appendix">
<header>
<h2>Appendix: Possible variations</h2>
</header>

<p>Some obvious variations on this proposal can be listed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Instead of saying that pragma-oblivious processors must ignore all
  pragmas, we could say that they that they must ignore all pragmas
  except namespace declarations.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of saying processors <em class="rfc2119">must</em> be able to ignore all pragmas, we
  might say they <em class="rfc2119">should</em> be able to ignore all pragmas.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of forbidding two namespace declarations for the same
  prefix, we could say they <em class="rfc2119">must</em> agree, or that the first one wins (as
  for entity declarations) or that the last one wins (as for multiple
  <code>let</code> clauses for the same variable in a FLWOR expression in
  XQuery).</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of requiring that in the XML form of an ixml grammar all
  namespaces bound in the ixml grammar <em class="rfc2119">should</em> be bound in the XML
  form of the grammar, we could say that those actually used <em class="rfc2119">must</em> be
  bound, or that they all <em class="rfc2119">must</em> be bound.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of using the prefix <em>ixmlns</em>, namespace declarations could
  use <em>xmlns</em>.  Strictly speaking, however, that name is reserved and
  it's not clear we have the standing to use it here.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of using pragma syntax, namespace declarations could use
  some other syntax.  E.g.</p>

<pre class="ixml"><code>prolog:  s, (ppragma; namespace)+s, s.
namespace: -'declare', s, -'namespace', s,
  @prefix, s, -'=', s, @ns-name, s, '.'.
  @prefix: name.
@ns-name: string.
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the examples shown above would take the form</p>

<pre class="ixml"><code>declare namespace xsd = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema".
declare namespace rng = "http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0".
</code></pre>
